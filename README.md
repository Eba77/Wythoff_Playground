In each of the folders labeled `application.????????`, there should be an executable that will run the program if you double click it.  Which folder you choose will depend on your system.

In the white box in the bottom right corner, there are two buttons to select \*332 or \*442 symmetry, and your mouse can control the blue dot (as long as your mouse is in the triangle in the white box, the blue dot will follow).

I've tested this on my Mac and it works, in theory it should work on your platform too, sorry if it doesn't...
